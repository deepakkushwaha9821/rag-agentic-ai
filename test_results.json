    "query": "How does Agentic AI differ from traditional AI systems?",
    "answer": "According to Chunk 1, Agentic AI differs from traditional AI systems in that it can handle unstructured inputs whereas traditional AI excels at repetitive, rule-based tasks with structured data.\n\nChunk 1: \"RPA excels at repetitive, rule-based tasks with structured data, like following a strict recipe. Agentic AI adapts to different situations, handling unstructured inputs.\" According to this chunk, RPA and Agentic AI have distinct capabilities based on the type of input they handle. Chunk 3 provides additional context about what makes Agentic AI unique: \"Agentic AI promises a shift from reactive to proactive problem-solving,\" indicating its ability to adapt in different situations rather than strictly following predefined rules.\n\nChunk 1 also mentions that traditional AI systems are categorized as non-agentic, which means they lack autonomy and cannot learn or adapt. This contrasts with the capabilities of Agentic AI mentioned earlier: \"Agentic AI adapts to new situations\" and can handle unstructured inputs. According to Chunk 3, this adaptation is a key feature distinguishing it from traditional AI systems.\n\nChunk 5 provides additional context about how these types of AI differ in their approach to problem-solving and decision-making:\n\n- Traditional AI (non-agentic) executes predefined rules and logic.\n- Agentic AI learns and adapts to new situations. According to Chunk 3, \"Agentic AI promises a shift from reactive to proactive problem-solving.\"\n- Non-agentic AI lacks autonomy.\n\nIn summary, traditional AI systems are rule-based with structured data inputs, while agentic AI is autonomous in handling unstructured inputs and can adapt to different scenarios. This makes Agentic AI more versatile for complex tasks that require flexibility rather than strict adherence to predefined rules. According to Chunk 3: \"Agentic AI promises a shift from reactive to proactive problem-solving,\" indicating its ability to learn, adapt, and take independent action in response to new situations.",
